# modreveal

`modreveal` is a small utility that prints the names of hidden LKMs if any exists.

## Usage

```
make
sudo ./modreveal
```

## Notes

- To test the utility, you can use Diamorphine rootkit (https://github.com/m0nad/Diamorphine).
- The author runs Arch Linux LTS kernel, so it is only guaranteed to work on Arch Linux LTS kernel. It will most likely work with your kernel too unless you are running something ancient or really new that breaks something.
